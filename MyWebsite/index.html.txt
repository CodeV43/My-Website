   This is a small introduction in to who I am as the creator of this webpage. I am Vanessa Rendel. 
   I currently, work for Amazon fulfilment Center as FC Associate. Through my employer I was able to enroll in correlation-one.
    Where I am studying web/software development. Prior to working at Amazon I have a variety of background in retail, customer service, healthcare, and community service.
     I currently hold a bachelors degree in Arts for Social Work and prior to beginning, I gained a certification for Mechatronics. I like to keep busy and be able to adapt to the times, whether it be people or workforce. <br>
   In my spare time, when I am not working or in school.
 You can find me outside gardening or walking trails in my area. 
 I love to travel no place to big or small, close or far an adventure is an adventure.
  I enjoy cooking, painting, listening to music and binge watching movies. 
  Whether riding solo or enjoying the company of good family and friends, I love to live life for the moment. 
  This site is to showcase my lessons and events learned (School, Work and Personal life) 30 years around the sun.<br>

  <h2> My Journey </h2>
  <p>Before enrolling into this program I had no prior tech skills, I didint even really know what coding was.
     In the beginning was tough and is still a little difficult at times but after sticking to it. 
     I can honestly say I rather enjoying learn all this new and different skills. 
     My confidence as grown and continues to grow with each completed section. 
     It takes my a little longer than the rest but it is well worth the effort, just to see my results. 
     My favorite part is being able to implement was I learned in my assignments. 
     I can use; tables, image maps, change background colors, change the page format, connect links from different sources and so much more.<br>
